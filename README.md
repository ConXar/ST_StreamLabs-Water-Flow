# ST_StreamLabs-Water-Flow
This is an unofficial Classic SmartThings interface to the StreamLabs Water Flow Meter [Streamlabs Water Monitor](https://www.streamlabswater.com/). It allows SmartThings to be able to control the StreamLabs Home/Away status as well as providing StreamLabs flow alerts as SmartThings water leaks.
## Getting Started
The StreamLabs API runs in the cloud; for SmartThings to interrogate cloud interfaces, it requires two pieces: a Device Handler and a SmartApp.


These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Getting an API Key
You will need to do is request an API key for your account. Follow the instructions on the [Streamlabs Getting Started](https://developer.streamlabswater.com/docs/getting-started.html) page to request your API key. This interface supports the API key mode of authentication (OAUTH2 is not currently supported), so make sure you follow the steps to request that.
